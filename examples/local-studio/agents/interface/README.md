## [Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent)
 
User Interaction Agent is the main interface for receiving user instructions, coordinating multi-agent tasks, and logging conversations via the terminal.

## Responsibility
User Interaction Agent acts as the main interface for coordinating user instructions and managing multi-agent tasks. It interacts with the user via terminal and orchestrates requests among various agents, ensuring seamless workflow and conversation logging.

## Setup the Agent

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

<details>  

```bash
# In a new terminal clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Coral-Interface-Agent

# Download and run the UV installer, setting the installation directory to the current one
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd) sh

# Create a virtual environment named `.venv` using UV
uv venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# install uv
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```

</details>

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Get the API Key:
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or [GROQ](https://console.groq.com/keys)

<details>

```bash
# Create .env file in project root
cp -r .env_sample .env
```
</details>

## Run the Agent

You can run in either of the below modes to get your system running.  

- The Executable Model is part of the Coral Protocol Orchestrator which works with [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio).  
- The Dev Mode allows the Coral Server and all agents to be seperately running on each terminal without UI support.  

### 1. Executable Mode

Checkout: [How to Build a Multi-Agent System with Awesome Open Source Agents using Coral Protocol](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/existing-agent-sessions-tutorial-private-temp) and update the file: `coral-server/src/main/resources/application.yaml` with the details below, then run the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) and [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio). You do not need to set up the `.env` in the project directory for running in this mode; it will be captured through the variables below.

<details>

For Linux or MAC:

```bash

registry:
  # ... your other agents
  interface-agent:
    options:
      - name: "MODEL_API_KEY"
        type: "string"
        description: "API key for the model provider"
      - name: "MODEL_NAME"
        type: "string"
        description: "What model to use (e.g 'gpt-4.1')"
        default: "gpt-4.1"
      - name: "MODEL_PROVIDER"
        type: "string"
        description: "What model provider to use (e.g 'openai', etc)"
        default: "openai"
      - name: "MODEL_MAX_TOKENS"
        type: "string"
        description: "Max tokens to use"
        default: 16000
      - name: "MODEL_TEMPERATURE"
        type: "string"
        description: "What model temperature to use"
        default: "0.3"

    runtime:
      type: "executable"
      command: ["bash", "-c", "<replace with path to this agent>/run_agent.sh main.py"]
      environment:
        - option: "MODEL_API_KEY"
        - option: "MODEL_NAME"
        - option: "MODEL_PROVIDER"
        - option: "MODEL_MAX_TOKENS"
        - option: "MODEL_TEMPERATURE"


```

For Windows, create a powershell command (run_agent.ps1) and run:

```bash
command: ["powershell","-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-File", "${PROJECT_DIR}/run_agent.ps1","main.py"]
```

</details>

### 2. Dev Mode

Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system and run below command in a separate terminal.

<details>

```bash
# Run the agent using `uv`:
uv run python main.py
```

You can view the agents running in Dev Mode using the [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio) by running it separately in a new terminal.

</details>


## Example

<details>


```bash
# Input:
Agent: How can I assist you today?

#Output:
The agent will interact with you directly in the console and coordinate with other agents as needed.
```
